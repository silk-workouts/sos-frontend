            Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver.
          </h3>
          <p className={styles.content}>
            Please read the following Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class

          </p>
          <p className={styles.content}>
            Please read this Provision carefully. It provides that all Disputes
            (as defined below) between you and 100% SILK arising out of this
            Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is a
            form of private dispute resolution and replaces the right to go to
            court. In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may
            otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court,
            before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented
            in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to,
            class actions). Except as otherwise provided, entering into this
            Agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims in
            court and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is
            no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration
            award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can
            award the same damages and relief as a court (including
            attorney&apos;s fees).

            each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.
            The term &quot;Dispute&quot; means any dispute, claim, or

            of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the

            shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this
            Provision.

            For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the
            AAA&apos;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes
            will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA&apos;s
            Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the
            AAA&apos;s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall
            apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling
            1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive
            Arbitration Rules & Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration
            Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The
            JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling
            1-800-352-5267. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts
            with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will
            class action or representative action procedures or rules apply to
            the arbitration. Because the 100% SILK Platform and this Agreement
            concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act
            (&quot;FAA&quot;) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes.
            However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law
            consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or
            condition precedent to suit.

            Arbitration Award – The arbitrator may award on an individual basis
            any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and
            will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the
            benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The
            arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a
            statement of reasons unless requested by a party or if required by
            applicable law. Such award will be final and binding on the parties,
            except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA or other
            applicable law, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
            over the parties for purposes of enforcement.

          <p className={styles.content}>
            Location of Arbitration – You or 100% SILK may initiate arbitration
            in either New York City, New York or the federal judicial district
            that includes your billing address. However, if 100% SILK initiates
            the arbitration in New York City, you shall have the right to have
            the arbitration transferred to the AAA or JAMS office within the
            federal judicial district that includes your billing address.

            Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs – 100% SILK will pay all
            arbitration filing fees and AAA or JAMS hearing fees and any
            arbitrator&apos;s hearing fees, costs and expenses upon your written
            request to the arbitrator given at or before the first evidentiary
            hearing in the arbitration. You are responsible for all additional
            fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not
            limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be
            awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. In addition to any
            rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you
            provide notice and negotiate in good faith with 100% SILK as
            provided in the section above titled &quot;Pre-Arbitration Claim
            Resolution&quot; and the arbitrator concludes that you are the
            prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover
            reasonable attorney&apos;s fees and costs as determined by the
            arbitrator.

          <h3 className={styles.title}>Class Action Waiver</h3>
          <p className={styles.content}>
            Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may
            not consolidate more than one person&apos;s claims, and may not
            otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative
            proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action,
            representative action, or private attorney general action) unless
            both you and 100% SILK specifically agree to do so in writing
            following initiation of the arbitration. If you choose to pursue
            your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as
            specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you.
            Except to the extent that representative claims under
            California&apos;s Private Attorney General Act (&quot;PAGA&quot;)
            are excluded from this Agreement (if PAGA is applicable), neither
            you, nor any other user of the 100% SILK Platform can be a class
            representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class,
            consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied

          <p className={styles.content}>
            Arbitration does not involve a judge or jury. You understand and
            agree that by entering into this Agreement you and 100% SILK are
            each giving up the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge
            in a public court. In the absence of this Provision, you and 100%
            SILK might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring
            Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate
            or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including
            class actions). Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are
            waived. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such
            as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be
            more limited or may also be waived.

            clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of
            this Provision will be given full force and effect. If the Class
            Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this

            As to all Disputes, whether in arbitration or in court, the Federal
            Arbitration Act, New York state law, and applicable U.S. federal
            law, without regard to their choice of law or conflicts of law
            provisions, will govern this Agreement. Foreign laws do not apply.
            The United Nations on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
            and any laws based on the Uniform Computer Information Transactions
            Act (UCI100% SILK) shall not apply to this Agreement. Except for
            Disputes subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes
            relating to this Agreement, the 100% SILK Platform, or the Materials
            will be heard in the federal or state courts located in New York
            City in the State of New York. If any terms of this Agreement are
            found to be inconsistent with applicable law, then such terms shall
            be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no
            other terms will be modified. Our failure to enforce any provisions
            of this Agreement is not a waiver of such term. The section titles
            in this Agreement are for convenience purposes only and have no
            legal or contractual effect. This Agreement is not assignable,
            transferable or sub-licensable by you except with our prior written
            consent. However, we may assign this Agreement to any third-party
            whom we choose without your consent. No waiver by 100% SILK of any
            breach or default hereunder shall be deemed a waiver of any
            preceding or subsequent breach or default. This Agreement is the
            entire agreement between you and 100% SILK and supersedes all prior
            or contemporaneous oral or written negotiations, discussions or
